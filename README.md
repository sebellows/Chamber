Chamber is a WordPress theme for small community and government organizations like a Chamber of Commerce or a Convention & Visitor's Bureau. This theme is currently under active development and I wouldn't use it if I were you. Yet.

This originally started out as some godforsaken mashup of an [Underscores](http://underscores.me/) starter theme and another starter theme by the [Roots](https://roots.io/sage/) folks, but then I threw out their Gulp build and crammed [Laravel Elixir](https://github.com/laravel/elixir/) in there instead, yanked out Bootstrap and replaced it with [Foundation 6.3 by Zurb](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/), and, finally, ignored Bower in favor of just using NPM in order to reduce the number of package managers down to two (the other one being Composer).
